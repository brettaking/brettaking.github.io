        <p class="lead">Our Democracy Spring Vote Project aims to engage citizens in the political process and encourage them to participate in all local, state, and national elections. Our democracy has been compromised by big money and corporate lobbyists who use their power to sway the decisions of our elected officials. Americans find themselves disengaged from politics and discouraged from working to bring about change. Across the country, over half of eligible voters do not vote. Politicians and special interest groups count on voter apathy and indifference. Our Democracy Spring Vote Project wants to change this by building a movement among local citizens to take back our democracy and put the power of governance back in to the hands of the people.</p>
		<br>
	 <p class="lead">Democracy is more than just voting! To take back our democracy, we must make a commitment to ourselves and our community to be informed about local, state, and national issues. We must pledge to vote in every election. We must be civic-minded and engaged with our representatives. We must be passionate about the issues important to us and dedicated to changing our political landscape. We must stand in opposition to monied interests and the corporate state. Together, we CAN restore power to the hands of the people and create a political system that is responsive to the needs of all of us.
